                <h2>Juveniles’ Competence to Stand Trial Consultation and Training Services</h2>
                <p>In recent years, the demand for forensic evaluations of juveniles’ competence to stand trial (CST) has increased rapidly. Many states have adopted new statutes and requirements for evaluating and adjudicating juveniles’ CST. This has increased the need for training of clinical and legal professionals in this area. NYSAP offers three services related to juveniles’ CST: Systems Consultation, and two kinds of Training for Clinicians and Legal Professionals.</p>
                <h3>Systems Consultation</h3>
                <p>Many states seek to develop standards, policies and procedures for implementing juvenile CST evaluations. NYSAP professionals have produced a guide for court and mental health administrators to assist in developing such standards and policies. <mark>
                        <!-- ALLY DO SOMETHING WITH THIS-->Click here for a free download of “Developing Service Delivery Systems for Evaluations of Juveniles’ Competence to Stand Trial: A Guide for States and Counties.”</mark> NYSAP provides consultation to administrators that tailors the application of this guide to the needs of a specific state or county.</p>
                <h3>JCST Evaluation Training for Clinicians and Legal Professionals</h3>
                <p>NSYAP professionals provide training for those who perform juvenile CST evaluations, as well as for lawyers and juvenile court judges who use clinicians’ testimony. One- and two-day on-site training is provided by NYSAP professionals who have been at the forefront in the development of systematic forensic assessment methods in juvenile CST evaluations.
                    <!-- ALLY DO SOMETHING WITH THIS--><mark>Click here for innovative juvenile CST publications by NSYAP professionals. </mark>Trainings can be provided to clinicians who are responsible for performing juvenile CST evaluations, as well as to lawyers and juvenile court judges who use and apply the results of those evaluations in juvenile CST cases. </p>
                <h3>JACI Training for Clinicians</h3>
                <p>NYSAP personnel developed the <em>Juvenile Adjudicative Competence Interview (JACI)</em>, currently the only structured method designed specifically for juvenile competence to stand trial evaluations.  NYSAP professionals can provide half-day or one-day trainings to forensic clinicians focusing specifically on the use of this tool.</p>
